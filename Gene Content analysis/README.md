Here you can find all the datasets and RevBayes scripts used for the analysis of the gene content matrices.

There are three different datasets, one including the output from the OrthoFinder analysis, without taking into account orphans or singletons; the second includes all the genes present in
at least 1 Holozoa, searched with the Phylogenetic Aware Parsing Script (Paps & Holland, 2018), this one including singletons and orphans; and the third corresponds to the dataset generated
with the Phylogenetic Aware Parsing Script that includes at least 1 Metazoa, and that presents the Cnidaria as outgroup.
